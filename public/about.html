  and my sister is named Shofiyyah Nurhasan, she goes to ABA-IS class 3 and she is 9 years old, she has a very naughty attitude, is difficult to control, and is fun.</p>


<p>At ABA-IS there are ICT lessons where I learn how to create websites and how to create our websites using two applications, namely Figma and Visual Studio Code.
  In Visual Studio Code, there are things that are fun and things that are not. What's fun is that you can learn to create websites and are very young.
  it's not too easy</p>
